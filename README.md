Hello I need a object like this from the file

`const timetable = {
  Monday: {
    815: {
      Room1: "Math",
      Room2: "History"
    },
    1130: {
      Room1: "Physics",
      Room3: "Chemistry"
    },
    // Other time slots can be similarly populated
  },
  Tuesday: {
    815: {
      Room1: "English",
      Room2: "Geography"
    },
    1130: {
      Room1: "Biology",
      Room3: "Computer Science"
    },
    // Other time slots can be similarly populated
  },
  // Other days can be similarly populated
};`

console.log(timetable);
